    The main thing about me is that I have epilepcy. Even though I have this problem I have succeed in the many things I have done.
    I have good grades in all my classes in school.
The grades in all my classes are A to B- I say that it is impressive.
At West High School I have gotten an (A) in all my computer design classes.
When I have free time like when I am at my house then I will watch YouTube videos or go to Google and go to the webcite shown on (Anime I Enjoy) page.
